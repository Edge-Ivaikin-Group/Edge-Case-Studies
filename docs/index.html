                            <li>
                                Increased the frequency of releases by 7 times (new release
                                1 time in 2 days, previously 1 time in 2 weeks) and built

                                Eliminated all critical bugs on the release (previously it
                                had at least 2 critical bugs per month due to a sharp
                                scaling of the business), and the number of non-critical
                                errors was reduced by 20%.

                            <li>

                                Reached velocity of at least 14 story-points per sprint for
                                1 team member with a low variance of deviations (previously

                        closure speed, user satisfaction). Introduced a systematic
